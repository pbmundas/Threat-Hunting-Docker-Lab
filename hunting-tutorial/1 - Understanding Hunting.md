Start your **practical threat hunting journey** from zero. I‚Äôll guide you step by step, using your **Docker-based ELK + ElastAlert2 lab** as the hands-on platform. I‚Äôll break this into multiple hunting steps, each with practical exercises, so you can truly understand how threat hunting works in real SOC scenarios.

Let‚Äôs start **Hunt 1: Foundations of Threat Hunting**.

## **Hunt 1: Understanding Threat Hunting Fundamentals**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is Threat Hunting?

Threat hunting is a **proactive process** where analysts look for malicious activity **before alerts are triggered**. Unlike traditional SIEM monitoring, which reacts to alerts, hunting:

* Searches for subtle anomalies in logs and network activity.
* Hypothesizes attacker behavior (TTPs).
* Investigates and validates findings.
* Improves detection rules (feedback loop).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Core Components in Your Lab

Your Docker setup already has everything you need:

| Component         | Purpose for Hunting                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elasticsearch** | Stores and indexes all logs for fast querying.             |
| **Logstash**      | Ingests logs from Mordor dataset, PCAP, or JSON.           |
| **Kibana**        | Visualizes logs, builds dashboards, and performs searches. |
| **ElastAlert2**   | Generates alerts based on detection rules.                 |

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Log Sources You Can Use

Threat hunting relies heavily on logs. Here‚Äôs what you have and why they matter:

1. **Sysmon (Windows)** ‚Äì Detects process creation, registry changes, network connections.
2. **Windows Event Logs** ‚Äì Tracks authentication, process events, security policy changes.
3. **Zeek / Suricata (Network)** ‚Äì Network traffic metadata; C2 connections, scans, lateral movement.
4. **Mordor JSON Logs** ‚Äì Pre-generated attack simulations: PowerShell abuse, credential dumping, C2 activity.

**Key idea:** Every log is a piece of the puzzle. Effective hunting means combining multiple log sources to see the full attack picture.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Hunting Features in Your Lab

* **Logs** ‚Üí raw investigation and search.
* **Dashboards** ‚Üí visualize suspicious patterns or TTPs.
* **Alerts (ElastAlert)** ‚Üí notify when predefined suspicious activity occurs.
* **Filters & Queries** ‚Üí narrow down by host, user, IP, process, etc.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Threat Hunting Workflow

Here‚Äôs a simple **practical workflow**:

1. **Create a hypothesis** ‚Üí e.g., ‚ÄúAn attacker may use PowerShell to download malware.‚Äù
2. **Identify relevant logs** ‚Üí Sysmon process creation, network logs, Windows events.
3. **Search logs in Kibana** ‚Üí build queries or filters.
4. **Investigate anomalies** ‚Üí look for unusual commands, failed logins, or unknown hosts.
5. **Validate & escalate** ‚Üí confirm if it‚Äôs malicious, then trigger alerts.
6. **Refine detections** ‚Üí add new ElastAlert rules based on findings.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Example Starting Point in Your Lab

* Open **Kibana ‚Üí Discover**.
* Select **mordor-* index**.
* Filter for suspicious PowerShell commands:

  ```text
  NewProcessName: "powershell.exe" AND CommandLine: "*Invoke-WebRequest*"
  ```
* Observe patterns ‚Üí see if any hosts executed unusual commands.

---

### Key Takeaways

* Logs are your ‚Äúsensor data‚Äù for hunting.
* Dashboards help you **spot anomalies visually**.
* Alerts are **reactive support** to hunting, not the primary hunting tool.
* Threat hunting is iterative ‚Üí hypothesis ‚Üí investigation ‚Üí validation ‚Üí feedback.
