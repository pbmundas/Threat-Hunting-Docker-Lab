Fantastic — Lesson coming right up. This lesson closes the loop: **how to turn hunts into repeatable playbooks, automate detection + validation, measure effectiveness, and continuously improve** your lab’s hunting posture. I’ll give you a practical, ready-to-use threat‑hunting playbook template, automation steps (what to wire into ElastAlert / Kibana / Docker lab), testing strategies, metrics to track, and example artifacts you can drop straight into your environment.

# Lesson — Building a Threat‑Hunting Playbook & Automating the Feedback Loop

---

## 1) The purpose of a hunting playbook

A playbook converts a hypothesis + queries into a repeatable investigation and detection process. It ensures hunts are consistent, auditable, and yield artifacts that feed detection engineering (rules/dashboards/tests).

---

## 2) Playbook Template (copy / paste and adapt per technique)

Use this template for every technique (e.g., PowerShell abuse, Credential Dumping, C2, Exfiltration):

**Playbook: [Technique Name — MITRE Txxxx]**

1. **Overview**

   * Technique: e.g., PowerShell abuse (T1059.001)
   * Objective: What you will find and why it matters.
   * Confidence threshold: High / Medium / Low

2. **Hypothesis**

   * Example: “Compromised hosts will execute PowerShell with `-EncodedCommand` or `-nop` to retrieve additional payloads.”

3. **Data sources**

   * Required: Sysmon (process creation & network), Windows Security (4688), PowerShell logging (ScriptBlock), Zeek/Suricata (network)
   * Optional: EDR memory artifacts, Filebeat file events

4. **Kibana queries**

   * Saved Query name: `hunt_powershell_encoded_v1`
   * Query (KQL):

     ```
     process_name: "powershell.exe" and (command_line: "*-EncodedCommand*" or command_line: "*-nop*" or command_line: "*IEX*")
     ```
   * Fields to display: `@timestamp, host.name, user.name, process.parent.name, process.command_line, process.hash`

5. **Investigation steps**

   * Step 1: Pull events for `host` in last 24/72 hours.
   * Step 2: Build parent→child chain for process GUIDs.
   * Step 3: Decode any encoded commands and inspect contents.
   * Step 4: Search for persistence artifacts (services/tasks/registry).
   * Step 5: Check network connections and destination reputation (lab: flag external IPs).
   * Step 6: Assign initial severity (Low/Med/High) & recommend containment.

6. **Enrichment & context**

   * Add: hostname asset tag, known admin accounts, whitelist of approved admin tools, historical frequency baseline.
   * Attach: binary hash lookup table (local DB in lab).

7. **Containment & remediation**

   * Contain: isolate host in lab (simulate network isolation).
   * Remediate: kill process, remove persistence, rotate credentials (if relevant), collect forensic snapshot.
   * Document changes in ticket.

8. **Detection rule(s) to create / tune**

   * ElastAlert rule: `powershell_encoded.yml` (skeleton below).
   * Threshold / suppression notes: avoid noisy admin windows; use `user.name NOT in (admin_whitelist)`.

9. **Test & validation**

   * Reference test case(s): sample Mordor events or Atomic Red Team test steps to simulate encoded PowerShell.
   * Expected alert: ElastAlert triggers and creates ticket; Kibana dashboard shows host flagged.

10. **Lessons learned / Next steps**

    * Tune rule parameters, add new queries, add dashboard panel to show decoded scripts, create enrichment lookup for known-good admins.

11. **Documentation**

    * Add this playbook to your repo: `playbooks/powershell_abuse.md` and version control it.

## 3) Example ElastAlert skeleton (plug into `elastalert/rules/`)

```yaml
# elastalert/rules/powershell_encoded.yml
name: "PowerShell Encoded Command - Hunt v1"
type: frequency
index: "mordor-*"
num_events: 1
timeframe:
  minutes: 5
filter:
- term:
    process_name: "powershell.exe"
- query:
    query_string:
      query: "command_line:(\"*-EncodedCommand*\" OR \"*-enc*\" OR \"*IEX*\" OR \"*Invoke-Expression*\")"
# Optional: exclude common admin accounts
filter:
- bool:
    must_not:
      - terms:
          user.name: ["DOMAIN\\AdminUser1", "DOMAIN\\SvcBackup"]
alert:
- "email"  # replace with webhook/ticketing or Slack
alert_text: "PowerShell encoded command detected on {0}: {1}"
alert_text_args:
- host.name
- process.command_line
```

> Tune `num_events`/`timeframe` and `user` whitelist for your lab noise profile.

## 4) Automating the feedback loop — pipeline overview

1. **Hunt → Findings**

   * Analyst runs playbook queries or receives ElastAlert. Findings documented in ticket system (or a CSV/Markdown in repo).

2. **Findings → Detection**

   * If confirmed malicious or high-confidence, engineer writes/updates ElastAlert/Sigma rule and Kibana saved query + dashboard panel.

3. **Detection → Test**

   * Add or update a test case that reproduces the detection using Mordor or Atomic Red Team steps (store samples in `tests/` folder).

4. **Test → CI**

   * In your lab, create a scheduled job (cron in host or a simple GitHub Actions for repo) that runs tests by ingesting sample logs into Logstash and asserts ElastAlert fires.

5. **CI → Metric & Reporting**

   * Collect metrics from ElastAlert logs and Kibana (alert counts, false positives). Store in dashboard for MTTD/MTTR tracking.

6. **Repeat**

   * Use findings to refine rules and playbooks.

---

## 5) Practical automation items to implement in your Docker lab

* **Alert sink**: Replace ElastAlert email with a webhook to a simple ticket generator (a small Python Flask app in another container that logs alerts as JSON files / creates GitHub issues).
* **Saved queries & dashboards**: Keep them in `kibana/dashboards/` and import automatically at `elk-setup` run.
* **Test harness**: Add `setup/tests/` with sample Mordor JSONs and a script `run_tests.sh` that:

  * POSTs test logs to Logstash ingest endpoint
  * Waits X seconds
  * Checks ElastAlert logs for expected alert
  * Writes test report to `/mnt/data/test_reports/`
* **Rule versioning**: Keep ElastAlert rules in `rules/` with `rule_metadata` fields: owner, created_date, test_case, last_tuned_by.
* **False-positive feedback**: A small UI (or a JSON file) where analysts flag alerts as FP — this feeds a `whitelist.json` used by rules.

---

## 6) Tests & validation strategy

* **Unit tests (detection)**: For each rule, have a positive sample and a negative sample.
* **Integration tests (end-to-end)**: Ingest positive sample, ensure ElastAlert triggers and ticket created.
* **Regression tests**: When tuning rule, run full test suite to ensure no other rules break / cause floods.
* **Periodic replay**: Weekly replay some benign logs and a few attack samples to check drift and new noise.

*Practical test idea*: create `tests/powershell_encoded/positive.json` (Mordor sample) and `tests/powershell_encoded/negative.json` (admin-run PowerShell baseline). Script ingests both and validates alerts only for the positive.

---

## 7) Metrics to measure hunting maturity

* **Hunt coverage**: % of MITRE technique playbooks implemented (target 80% for initial maturity)
* **Rules coverage**: # of ElastAlert/Sigma rules per tactic
* **Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)** — time from event ingestion to alert (or to detection in hunt)
* **Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)** — time from alert to containment action
* **False positive rate** — alerts marked FP / total alerts
* **Hunt success rate** — hunts that yield at least one confirmed finding / total hunts run
* **Test pass rate** — automated detection tests passing / total tests

Add these to a Kibana management dashboard.

---

## 8) Incident report template (short—use in tickets)

**Incident ID:**
**Technique:**
**Discovery method:** (Hunt / Alert / Endpoint detection)
**Host(s):**
**User(s):**
**Time window:** (first_seen — last_seen)
**Hypothesis:**
**Evidence:** (events, command lines, hashes, network destinations)
**Correlation:** (other alerts — credential dumping, C2, lateral movement)
**Impact:** (local/credential/privilege/exfil)
**Containment actions taken:**
**Remediation actions:**
**Lessons learned / Rule changes:**
**Artifacts:** (saved query name, ElastAlert rule file, test case filename)

---

## 9) Example: Full mini-workflow (PowerShell abuse)

1. Analyst runs `hunt_powershell_encoded_v1` in Kibana → finds host `HOST-123`.
2. Analyst documents finding in ticket, decodes `EncodedCommand`.
3. Analyst confirms malicious indicators and updates `elastalert/rules/powershell_encoded.yml` (tighten filters, add whitelist).
4. Engineer adds `tests/powershell_encoded/positive.json` and `negative.json` and adds test to `run_tests.sh`.
5. CI/cron executes tests — positive triggers ElastAlert webhook (ticket), negative does not. Test passes.
6. Dashboard `Hunting: PowerShell Abuses` gets updated with new panel showing alert counts and FP rate.
7. Metric: MTTD measured from ingest to alert. If too slow, tune Logstash/Elasticsearch or ElastAlert schedule.

---

## 10) Recommended prioritization & roadmap (first 90 days)

* Week 1–2: Convert lessons 2–9 into 6 playbooks in `playbooks/` (PowerShell, Credential Dumping, C2, Lateral Movement, Persistence, Exfiltration).
* Week 3: Implement ElastAlert rules from playbooks and create basic test samples.
* Week 4: Create `run_tests.sh` harness to verify rule firing; add webhook ticket sink.
* Month 2: Build dashboards for metrics (MTTD/MTTR/FP rate), automate weekly replay tests.
* Month 3: Iterate on playbooks, add 5 additional MITRE techniques, and create a monthly hunting report template.
